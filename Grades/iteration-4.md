# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 8

**Evaluator: Scott Smith (mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**

## Git

All Looks good here: issues, branches, commits, etc.

## Running project

Projects builds well for me, tests run well.  I did not check test coverage, Junit alone would not run and you didn’t have Maven configured to do coverage.  Try to get some test coverage added to your Maven build file.

I can’t create an account (Register link broken) so cannot test beyond that point.

Well, trying in Chrome I got beyond that but the file upload would not work. -4


## Iteration Plan

Looks good.

## Testing

Good.  Keep working on getting tests filled out and test coverage as outlined above. You get a bonus [+5] for getting Travis to work.

## Overall:

Your codebase is very clean.  The main thing you need to work on for iteration 5 is getting your code debugged and feature set built up.  One indication of this is your total lines of code is around 2000 now and 1000 per person is more the norm at the end of iteration 6.

**Grade: 101/100**
