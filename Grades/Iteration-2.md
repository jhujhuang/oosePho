# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 8

**Evaluator: Scott Smith (mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**

## RESTful API

* You need to add error codes for the different error messages in the RESTful API 

*-1 points*

## Javadocs and class diagram

You are lacking code/docs for the client side.  As per discussion you are going to have very few client-side operations in your initial iterations, thats OK but you should have mentioned something at least about this in the doc.

*-2 points*

## Overall:

Very good overall.

**Grade: 97/100**
