# Presentation

- Great start of your presentation. Motivation was clear and interesting.  But please look at audience and not at notes when speaking (first speaker only)

- Great slides, good images, no walls of text and drives the point home.

- Great timing. Covered everything and left time for questions.

- Related code review to the material covered in class.

# Demo

- Increase point size on demo to make sure it's readable.

- Glitch on demo on the /user already registered/ part. Use real data on the
demos :)

- The blue font on the blue background on the UI is bad contrast.

- Simple and effective UI for the most part.  File - open is not a standard dialog format.  Put the images in a box or something.  In general as you mention in iteration 7 plans your front end is a little bit kludgy.

- Good coverage of edge cases.

- Version history feature - very nice!  You have developed a simple but workable in practice editing model for multiple versions that average users will be able to relate to.


# Demo followup / Running the project

- It looks like you did not get anything more done on the database.

# Tests

- Good.

# GitHub Usage

- Excellent.

# Architecture

- You need to work on photo storage and to improve polling mode.   Web sockets is ultimately the right protocol given the high level of ingteractivity.

- But, this is more for future iterations, you made good progress.

# Code inspection

- Good.

# Iteration planning

- You were a bit weak on the integration front, the database lagged.  Given the number of group members you had, you probably could have allocated someone to the database.

# Project difficulty

- This was a challenging and interesting problem and interesting application.
- You didn't get quite as far as you could have, the database was not integrated and the UI was not polished, and the pencil tool was not done yet.
- Your lines of code were also on the light side compared to other projects, 2200 or thereabouts.
- But, you had a lot of technologies to learn and you did a great job on debugging and software engineering so overall it is a well-earned A.
