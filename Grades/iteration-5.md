# Iteration 5 Evaluation - Group 8

**Evaluator: Scott Smith (mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**

## Git

Good.  I notice you have not used git branches yet.  Thats probably fine given the scope of your project but keep them in mind for larger projects in the future.

## Running project

* Projects builds well for me, tests run well. 

* Running the project was not easy, it took several times before the upload option would work.  I could eventually get a photo to appear.  

* I did not understand that Upload was not also opening the photo but I eventually figured out I needed to Open it after uploading.  This is probably not the greatest workflow as it is nonstandard.

* Once I got photos to load I could not get any of the filters to work.  

* Your toolbar usage is not clear, its not clear how one is supposed to apply a filter to a photo.  I notice in your html you have "TODO: Maybe make dropdown, for filter type selection, etc." - I agree.

* PNG files loaded with inverse color

* Photos were not resized to fit - put in a scrollbar box if the photo is too big (or just resize).

* Overall, you have been getting "less ahead" of the other groups in this iteration compared to the previous.  While you are still doing OK you have a lot of work left to go and hopfully you have the time to allocate to it.

*-7 points*

In looking at the code, you still don't have your persistence layer set up.  You should have worked this in earlier and not waited until the end as it is not always a completely independent addition.  You did state this in your iteration 4 plan but I didn't notice it unfortunately.


## Iteration Plan

Looks good.

## Testing

Good.  Good to see some effort on front-end testing.  Include instructions on running front-end tests with iteration 6.

## Code Quality

Generally your code is good - you are going a very good job of pulling out functionality into named methods, even in the JavaScript code.

## Overall:

You still have great code but have not added a lot since previous iteration - only a couple hundred new lines.  Lots of stuff left to go, good luck!

**Grade: 93/100**
