# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 8

**Evaluator: Scott Smith (mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**

## Overall:

You are using issues well, you have a straightforward automated build and deploy process, you have some tests running, your Travis is currently green, etc: all looks great!  

I didn't check your tests for coverage, make sure to get good test coverage for iteration 4.

**Grade: 100/100**
