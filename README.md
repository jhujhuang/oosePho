Pho
---

Pho is a collaborative photo editing platform. With the rise of smartphones and social media websites, photos have become an essential part of our everyday life. We use photos to record important moments and share with friends. However, we find most cutting-edge photo editing tools are lacking of collaboration features. We hope this project can fill in this gap and make photo editing even easier.

Build
-----

The code should be directly importable as an existing Maven project into Eclipse or IntelliJ, and should directly build and run from within the IDE.  You need to set up a run configuration to run <tt>Bootstrap.main()</tt>.

If you instead want to compile and run from the command line, assuming you have the Maven command line installed:

```console
mvn package
java -jar target/Pho1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Now simply point your browser to http://localhost:8080 to use the application.
